![A beeg Truth or Dare game logo](./BTOD.svg)

An extendable game of Truth or Dare with a curses interface, that started as a drunken joke with a group of friends.
TTOD used to mean 'Terminal Truth or Dare' but all titles say 'Terrible Truth o Dare' because I have memory problems.

# Use:
As of right now the '\_\_main\_\_.py' should import the Terminal User Interface correctly.
The questions are located in a yaml file in translations/{language}/

# Future:
Questions can be added to the file without any mayor issues. The more the better so I might update it sometime.

There are currently no translations for the questions. I'll add ones in Spanish sometime.

There is no functioning options menu.

Players cannot be saved to a file for a quick start.

# Credit:
Most of the questions as of right now were adapted from:

More questions and translations for the ones already written are apreciated.
